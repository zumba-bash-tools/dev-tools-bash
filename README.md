# dev-tools-bash
A few tools for doing things on command line

Useful for other software engineers that work **in the tech departnment at the company I work** and have local environments set up with the `dev` commands.

# Setup

1. First check out this repo into your normal folder for git repos.
2. Add the following line to your `.profile` or `.bash_profile` file in your home folder (change 0 to 1 for specialty tools to enable, see [Conditional Commands](#conditional-commands)):
    ```
    # Enable / Disable Specialty Tools
    export DEVTOOLS_phpunit=0
    export DEVTOOLS_job=0
    export DEVTOOLS_listener=0

    # Include the dev-tools
    . ~/zumba/git/dev-tools-bash/dev-tools.sh
    ```

3. Open a new console and try out one of the new `dev-` commands.

# Commands

Note that any of these tools that require the `<CONTAINER>`, you only have to specify the first part, you can **leave off `-development`**.  The tools always assume you are working in development.  They also make a few other assumptions, so if a command errors, it could be because you are missing one of the containers or apps or something like that.

List of commands:

* [dev-create](#dev-create) *app auto-detected*
* [dev-build](#dev-build) *app auto-detected*
* [dev-ssh](#dev-ssh)
* [dev-log](#dev-log) *app auto-detected*
* [dev-test](#dev-test) *app auto-detected*
* [dev-phpunit](#dev-phpunit)
* [dev-job](#dev-job)
* [dev-listener](#dev-listener)
* [dev-clear](#dev-clear)
* [dev-restart](#dev-restart)
* [dev-xdebug-init](#dev-xdebug-init)
* [dev-init-primer](#dev-init-primer)
* [dev-env](#dev-env) *app auto-detected*
* [dev-rebuild-usersearch](#dev-rebuild-usersearch)

*app auto-detected*: If you are already in an app's base folder, the app name can be omitted from these commands and it will use the app you are in.

Commands that require adding `DEVTOOLS-commandname=1` to use (see [Conditional Commands](#conditional-commands))

* [phpunit](#phpunit)
* [job](#job)
* [listener](#listener)


## dev-create

**usage:**
```bash
dev-create [app-name]
```

`[app-name]` optional: if ommitted, will use current directory for the app.

Shortcut for creating a container, you only have to specify the app name as long as it matches the contain name.  It also enables the xdebug grain by default.

## dev-build

**usage:**
```bash
dev-build [app-name]
```

`[app-name]` optional: if omitted, will use current directory for the app.

If the app name and container do not match and is not derived by the app name, you can specify both:

```bash
dev-build [container] [app-name]
```
Note that most miss-matched naming is accounted for you like `primer` automatically assumes `jobs` container, so specifying both is not often needed.

## dev-ssh

**usage:**
```bash
 dev-ssh [app-name] [username or 1]
```

`[app-name]` optional: will `ssh` into `guest` if omitted.

`[username or 1]` optional: If you use a string it will use that as the username starting out.  If you pass in 1 it will use the same username as the app.  If omitted it will use root.

**example:** SSH to netsuite (automatically uses job box) with root user:
```bash
dev-ssh netsuite
```

**example:** SSH to service with service user:
```bash
dev-ssh service 1
```

Note: no arguments will ssh into the guest box, it will not derive the container based on current folder.  If you want that, use [`dev-test`](#dev-test) instead.

## dev-log

**usage:**
```bash
dev-log [app-name] [line-count]
```

`[app-name]` optional: if omitted, will use current directory for the app.

`[line-count]` optional: if omitted, will start with default of 10, note that the app name is not needed to specify number of lines.

This does a little more than just a simple `dev show-logs --container ...`, it also specifies the log file to use depending on the specific container / app.  For instance, if you use `dev-log service` it will use `/tmp/zs_debug`.

If you need the system log you may just need to use the normal `dev show-logs` command directly.

## dev-test

**usage:**
```bash
dev-test [app-name]
```

`[app-name]` optional: if omitted, will use current directory for the app.

Starts SSH, puts you in the app folder `/var/www/[app-name]/current`, and sets up alias for `phpunit` so you can use `phpunit ...` instead of `./vendor/bin/phpunit ...` or similar.

**Difference from `dev-phpunit`:** This opens a shell in the container instead of running phpunit in the container once, so is useful for for running phpunit multiple times, or if you need to do anything in the container and just want to start in the `/var/www/app/current` folder.

**Note:** while the shell is open, any ssh calls into the same container/app/user will also be set up as described above as it temporarily changes the `.bash_profile` for the app user.

## dev-phpunit

**usage:**
```bash
dev-phpunit [app-name] [phpunit argument(s)]
```

`[app-name]` **not** optional: since this accepts any number of arguments, to simplify everything, it will not try to auto-detect the app.  If you want that see the [`phpunit`](#phpunit) command.

`[phpunit argument(s)]` optional: specify whatever you want to pass to phpunit on the command line.  See examples below.

**example:**  Run phpunit for UserTest model in service:
```bash
dev-phpunit service Zumba/Test/Model/UserTest.php
```
**Difference from `dev-test`:** this runs a single phpunit command without having to go into the container

## dev-job

**usage:**
```bash
dev-job [app-name] [job argument(s)]
```

`[app-name]` **not** optional: since this accepts any number of arguments, to simplify everything, it will not try to auto-detect the app.  If you want that see the [`job`](#job) command.

`[job argument(s)]` optional: just like running the job in the container, you don't need to provide any additional arguments, in which case it will print out the list of jobs available.  The arguments are just like you would expect, specify which job and which action to run that job (see examples below).

**example:**  Run ShopJob listJobs in service:
```bash
dev-job service ShopJob listJobs
```

**example:**  List all available jobs in userservice:
```bash
dev-job userservice
```

## dev-listener

**usage:**
```bash
dev-listener [app-name] [listener class]
```

`[app-name]` **not** optional: since this accepts any number of arguments, to simplify everything, it will not try to auto-detect the app.  If you want that see the [`listener`](#listener) command.

`[listener class]` The listener class to run.

**example:**  Run AddressListener in service:
```bash
dev-listener service AddressListener
```

## dev-clear
**usage:**
```bash
dev-clear
```

This one is just an alias for `dev clear-caches`.  It originally did some extra stuff, but that stuff is now built into the main command, so today it's just an alias.

## dev-restart

**usage:**
```bash
dev-restart
```

For when things are just getting a little too funky in your VM.

This is the last step before calling Ghost Busters.  It actually halts the VM (not just suspend like `dev stop`) then starts it up again with `dev start`.

## dev-xdebug-init

**usage:**
```bash
dev-xdebug-init
```

This sets up the Visual Studio Code configurations for each app folder, and sets up a different port to use for each to make debugging multiple apps at same time possible.

If you use this, be sure to run it after using `dev update` since that will reset the ports to default in all the containers.

Note that after the script runs, it will give some instructions to make sure the VSC config files don't end up showing as changes in git.  You only need to follow those the first time.

## dev-init-primer

**usage:**
```bash
dev-init-primer
```

This initializes the **primer** app inside the **job-development** container.  Use this so you can run PHPUnit tests for primer inside the **job-development** container.

Make sure the **job-development** container is already created before calling this, if it is not you can create it using `dev-create primer` first.

If the job-development container is blown away and re-created, or if somehow primer is no longer set up in job-development container, just run this command again to re-initialize it.

## dev-env

**usage:**
```bash
dev-env [app-name] [param search]
```

`[app-name]` optional: if omitted, will use current directory for the app. Required if wishing to also include search params.

`[param search]`  optional: allows only showing lines that match (case insensitive)

This allows you to easily view the shared environment config without needing to ssh and other stuff.

#### Examples
**Get the full shared for userservice:**
```bash
dev-env userservice
```

**Get the mongo settings for userservice:**
```bash
dev-env userservice mongo
```

## dev-rebuild-usersearch

**usage:**
```bash
dev-rebuild-usersearch
```

This is for elastic search.  It **deletes** any existing user indexes, then runs the job to re-build the index.

You might ask "why"?  The answer is that the user search currently creates a new index every time you build it, meant to make it seamless in production so it will continue to use an old index while the new one is built.  This is not good for development because it leaves a bunch of extra indexes around.

Each user index that is full takes about a gig.  Run enough times it will quickly fill up your space on guest box.  If this happened to you, run the command and it will delete all the extra indexes and create just a single one.

**Running time:** Usually around **20 Minutes** to build the full index.

# Conditional Commands

These are commands that are available but are not "turned on" by default because they don't follow the typical usage for other tools.  Or it may break things depending on how you do things on your local.

So far, all of these are basically shortcuts that allow auto-detecting the app for commands that normally do not auto-detect the app since they accept additional arguments.  In other words, they allow you to `cd` into the app folder and use them without having to specify the app name each time.

## phpunit

To enable, in your **.bash_profile** file, set `DEVTOOLS_phpunit` to `1`.  Or if you are missing the line, add this above the line that includes dev-tools.sh file:
```bash
export DEVTOOLS_phpunit=1
```

**To use:**
This adds a handy alias for `phpunit`.  From the host machine, just `cd` into any app folder, then use `phpunit ...` directly in the folder.

This is basically a shortcut for calling `dev-phpunit app-name ...`, as long as you are in the app's main folder, no need to specify the app name.

**Warning:**
If you have phpunit already installed in the main path for your host machine, this may interfere with that.

**example:**
Run `phpunit` for user model in service:
```bash
cd zumba/git/service
phpunit Zumba/Test/Model/UserTest.php
```

## job

To enable, in your **.bash_profile** file, set `DEVTOOLS_job` to `1`.  Or if you are missing the line, add this above the line that includes dev-tools.sh file:
```bash
export DEVTOOLS_job=1
```

**To use:**
This adds a handy alias for running a job.  From the host machine, just `cd` into any app folder (that has jobs), then use `job ...` directly in the folder.

This is basically a shortcut for calling `dev-job app-name ...`, as long as you are in the app's main folder, no need to specify the app name.

**Warning:**
If you have `job` already resolves to something in bash, this may interfere with that.

**example**

List all the available jobs in service repo
```bash
cd zumba/git/service
job
```

## listener

To enable, in your **.bash_profile** file, set `DEVTOOLS_listener` to `1`.  Or if you are missing the line, add this above the line that includes dev-tools.sh file:
```bash
export DEVTOOLS_listener=1
```

**To use:**
This adds a handy alias for running a listener.  From the host machine, just `cd` into any app folder, then use `listener ...` directly in the folder.

This is basically a shortcut for calling `dev-listener app-name ...`, as long as you are in the app's main folder, no need to specify the app name.

**Warning:**
If you have `listener` already resolves to something in bash, this may interfere with that.

**example**
Run the benefit listener:
```bash
cd zumba/git/service
listener BenefitListener
```

# App from Current Directory

Some dev-* commands can derive the app or container to use based on the current folder that you run the command from.  Each command will document whether the app name is required or whether it can use the current directory.

# Special Apps

The dev-* tools are all built to automatically know which container to use for the following special case apps:

* **netsuite** - automatically uses **job-development** container
* **primer** - automatically uses **job-development** container
